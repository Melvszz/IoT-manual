# Manual
A quick guide


In this tutorial I'm going to show how to make an own interactive bot that works with some few commandoes.

Discord is a Skype/Whats-app social media app like that brings gamers together. They can have an own channel, check which game each member play, call each other and chat with each other. One of the possibilities is to add a bot to the server. This can either be an automated bot, or a bot that plays music for example.
